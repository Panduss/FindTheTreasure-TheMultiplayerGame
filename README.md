# Multiplayer Find the Treasure!

This repo contains a frontend and backend for a multiplayer tresure finder game. It uses Typescript, Koa, routing-controllers and TypeORM in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend. The backend exposes a REST API but also sends messages over websockets using SocketIO.

Built as a group assignment, on tic-tac-toe base game that we got from Codaisseur.
